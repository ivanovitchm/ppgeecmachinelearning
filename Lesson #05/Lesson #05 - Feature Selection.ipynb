It is desirable to reduce the number of input variables to both **reduce the computational cost of modeling** and, in many cases, to **improve the performance of the model**.\n","\n","Feature selection techniques may generally grouped into those that use the target variable (**supervised**) and those that do not (**unsupervised**). In the unsupervised feature techniques, the removal of redundant variables occur using correlation or features that have few values or low variance. Additionally, the supervised techniques can be further divided into models that automatically select features as part of fitting the model (intrinsic), those that explicitly choose features that result in the best performing model (wrapper) and those that score each input feature and allow a subset to be selected (fillter).\n","\n","<center>\n","<img width=\"600\" alt=\"feature selection\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=192CsZW0D4fgjmdg24BDT5eSryc7CyhjL\"></center>\n","\n","**Statistical-based** feature selection methods involve evaluating the relationship between each input variable and the target variable using statistics and selecting those input variables that have the strongest relationship with the target variable. These methods can be fast and effective, although the choice of statistical measures **depends on the data type** of both the input and output variables. As such, it can be challenging for a machine learning practitioner to select an appropriate statistical measure for a dataset when performing filter-based feature selection\n","\n","When **a mixture of input variable data types is present**, different filter methods can be used. Alternately, a **wrapper method** such as the popular Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method can be used that is **agnostic to the input variable type** although they **can be computationally expensive**. Wrapper feature selection methods create many models with di\u000berent subsets of input features and select those features that result in the best performing model according to a performance metric.\n","\n","In this section, you will discover how to choose feature selection methods with numerical and categorical data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"k-HyyRgiA-m4"},"source":["## 1.2 Statistics for feature selection (univariate selection)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"A6Uisek-BJqM"},"source":["It is common to use correlation type statistical measures between input and output variables as the basis for filter feature selection. As such, the choice of statistical measures is highly dependent upon the variable data types. Common data types include **numerical** (such as age) and **categorical** (such as a workclass), although each may be further subdivided such as integer and floating point for numerical variables, and boolean, ordinal, or nominal for categorical\n","variables. **Input variables** are those that are provided as input to a model. In feature selection, it is this group of variables that we wish to reduce in size. **Output variables** are those for which a model is intended to predict, often called the response variable.\n","\n","The type of response variable typically indicates the type of predictive modeling problem being performed. For example, a **numerical output** variable indicates a **regression predictive** modeling problem, and a **categorical output** variable indicates a **classifcation predictive** modeling problem.\n","\n","The statistical measures used in **filter-based feature selection** are generally calculated one input variable at a time with the target variable. As such, they are referred to as univariate statistical measures. **This may mean that any interaction between input variables is not considered in the filtering process.** \n","\n","**Most of these techniques are univariate**, meaning that they evaluate each predictor\n","in isolation.

Simple methods might create a tree of all possible combinations of input features and navigate the graph based on the pay-off, e.g. using a best-first tree searching algorithm.

The goal is to calculate a distribution of the test statistics over these many iterations. This distribution is called the **sampling distribution** and it approximates the full range of possible test statistics under the null hypothesis. We can then benchmark the test statistic we observed in the data (a mean difference of 2.52) to determine how likely it is to observe this mean difference under the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is true, that the weight loss pill doesn't help people lose more weight, than the observed mean difference of 2.52 should be quite common in the sampling distribution. If it's instead extremely rare, then we accept the alternative hypothesis instead.\n","\n","To simulate rerunning the study, we randomly reassign each data point (weight lost) to either group A or group B. We keep track of the recalculated test statistics as a separate list. By re-randomizing the groups that the weight loss values belong to, we're simulating what randomly generated groupings of these weight loss values would look like. We then use these randomly generated groupings to understand how rare the groupings in our actual data were.\n","\n","Ideally, the number of times we re-randomize the groups that each data point belongs to matches the total number of possible permutations. Usually, the number of total permutations is too high for even powerful supercomputers to calculate within a reasonable time frame. While we'll use 1000 iterations for now since we'll get the results back quickly, in later we'll learn how to quantify the tradeoff we make between accuracy and speed to determine the optimal number of iterations.\n","\n","Since we'll be randomizing the groups each value belongs to, we created a list named **all_values** that contains just the weight loss values."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"PfytVHcGRdX1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602521533021,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":808,"user":{"displayName":"Ivanovitch
