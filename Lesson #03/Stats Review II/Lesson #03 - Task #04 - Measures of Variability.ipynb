        "In this lesson, we learned how to measure the **variability** of a distribution using the **range**, the **mean absolute deviation**, the **variance**, and the **standard deviation**. These metrics are ideal for measuring the variability of distributions whose values are measured on an interval or ratio scale.\n",

For this reason, little is written in the literature about measuring variability for ordinal and nominal data. If you want to dig more into this, you can start by reading [this paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2007.11889465).\n",
