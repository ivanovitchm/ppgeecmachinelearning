The variability of the sampling was quite large, and many sample means were unrepresentative, being far from the population mean. In fact, this sampling method doesn't seem to perform better than simple random sampling:\n","\n","<center><img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1uoEz0OppoAB-I7-IK9r4A4SfQizf4UHZ\"></center>\n","\n","The poor performance is caused by a bad choice of strata. We stratified the data by the number of games played, but this isn't a good approach. A player is considered as having played one game even if she only played for one or two minutes. But others play 30 or 40 minutes, and they're still considered as having played one game.\n","\n","It makes more sense to stratify the data by number of minutes played, rather than by number of games played. The minutes played are a much better indicator of how much a player scored in a season than the number of games played.\n","\n","Our data set contains the total amount of minutes a player had for the entire season. If we make strata based on minutes played, and then sample proportionally using stratified sampling, we get something visibly better than simple random sampling (especially in terms of variability):\n","\n","<center><img width=\"800\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1dBdLH2qGGGdu4mph-2GzCVfuBoizO_Tq\"></center>\n","\n","\n","We increased the sample size to 12 so that we can do a better proportional sampling for the strata organized by minutes played.\n","\n","Here are a few guidelines for choosing good strata:\n","\n","**1. Minimize the variability within each stratum.**\n","\n","For instance, avoid having in the same stratum a player that has scored 10 points and a player that has scored 500. If the variability is high, it might be a sign that you either need a more granular stratification (need more strata), or you need to change the criterion of stratification (an example of criterion is minutes played).\n","\n","**2. Maximize the variability between strata.**\n","\n","Good strata are different from one another. If you have strata that are similar to one another with respect to what you want to measure, you might need a more granular stratification, or to change the stratification criterion. In the previous screen, stratifying the data by games played resulted in strata that weren't too different from each other with respect to the distribution of the total points. We managed to increase the variability between strata by changing the criterion of stratification to minutes played.\n","\n","**3. The stratification criterion should be strongly correlated with the property you're trying to measure.**\n","\n","For instance, the column describing minutes played (the criterion) should be strongly correlated with the number of total points (property we want to measure). We've covered briefly the concept of correlation in the pandas lessons, and we'll cover it again later in these statistics lessons, so don't worry if the concept of correlation doesn't make much sense to you now.\n","\n","We've left the code editor open for you to try to experiment with the different sampling methods we've learned so far. One thing you can try is to replicate the last graph above.

Let's suppose for a moment that there weren't such a site, and the data would be scattered instead across each individual team's website. There are twelve unique teams in our data set, which means we'd have to scrape twelve different websites, each requiring its own scraping script.\n","\n","This scenario is quite common in the data science workflow: you want to answer some questions about a population, but the data is scattered in such a way that data collection is either time-consuming, either close to impossible. For instance, let's say you want to analyze how people review and rate movies as a function of movie budget. There are a lot of websites out there that can help with data collection, but how can you go about so that you can spend one day or two on getting the data you need, rather than one month or two?\n","\n","One way is to list all the data sources you can find, and then randomly pick only a few of them to collect data from. Then you can sample individually each of the sources you've randomly picked. This sampling method is called **cluster sampling**, and each of the individual data sources is called a **cluster**.\n","\n","<center><img width=\"400\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1hS05bjdUFpy9xoLEqDeaoeFyb-Z9zGkZ\"></center>\n","\n","In our case, we'd first list all the possible data sources. Assuming that all the teams in our data set have a website where we can take data from, we end up with this list of clusters (each team's website is considered a cluster) :\n","\n","\n","```python\n",">> wnba['Team'].unique()\n","array(['DAL', 'LA', 'CON', 'SAN', 'MIN', 'SEA', 'PHO', 'CHI', 'WAS', 'NY',\n","       'ATL', 'IND'], dtype=object)\n"," ```\n"," \n"," Then we need to find a way to pick randomly a few clusters from our listing. There are many ways to do that, but the important thing to keep in mind is that we should avoid picking a cluster twice. Here's one way to sample four clusters randomly:\n","\n","```python\n"," >> pd.Series(wnba['Team'].unique()).sample(4, random_state = 0)\n","6     PHO\n","11    IND\n","4     MIN\n","10    ATL\n","dtype: object\n","```\n","\n","Once we picked the clusters, we move to collecting the data. We can collect all the data from each cluster, but we can also perform sampling on each. It's actually possible to use different sampling methods for different clusters. For instance, we can use stratified sampling on the first two clusters, and simple random sampling on the other two.\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","Let's simulate a cluster sampling on our data set.\n","\n","- Pick four team clusters randomly using the technique we've learned (use **random_state = 0**).\n","- Collect the data from each cluster without sampling the clusters.

The marketing team asks you to analyze the data and find categories of customers with a low buying rate, so that they can target their marketing campaigns at the right people. Instead of working with more than 10 million rows at each step of your analysis, you can save a lot of code running time by sampling several hundred rows, and perform your analysis on the sample. You can do a simple random sampling, but if you're interested in some categories beforehand, it might be a good idea to use stratified sampling.\n","\n","Let's consider a different situation. It could be that you need to collect data from an API that either has usage limit, or is not free. In this case, you are more or less forced to sample. Knowing how and what to sample can be of great use.\n","\n","Another common use case of sampling is when the data is scattered across different locations (different websites, different databases, different companies, etc.). As we've discussed in the previous screen, cluster sampling would be a great choice in such a scenario.\n","\n","Sampling is a vast topic in statistics, and there are other sampling methods besides what we've discussed.\n","\n","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)#Sampling_methods"]},{"metadata":{"id":"riX6SMYT0LuN","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 12.0 Descriptive and Inferential Statistics"]},{"metadata":{"id":"RA-V3x6e0mBH","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Practical statistical analysis revolves entirely around the distinction between a population and a sample.
