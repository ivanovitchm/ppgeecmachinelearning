In this lesson, we'll focus on understanding the structural parts of a data set, and how they're measured.\n","\n","Whether a **sample** or a **population**, a data set is generally an attempt to describe correctly a relatively small part of the world. The data set we worked with in the previous lesson describes basketball players and their performance in the season 2016-2017.\n","\n","Other data sets might attempt to describe the stock market, patient symptoms, stars from galaxies other than ours, movie ratings, customer purchases, and all sorts of other things.\n","\n","The things we want to describe usually have a myriad of properties. A human, for instance, besides the property of being a human, can also have properties like height, weight, age, name, hair color, gender, nationality, whether they're married or not, whether they have a job or not, etc.\n","\n","In practice, we limit ourselves to the properties relevant to the questions we want to answer, and to the properties that we can actually measure.

The height property in our data set is an example of a variable. In fact, all the properties described in our data set are variables.\n","\n","A row in our data set describes the actual values that each variable takes for a given individual.\n","\n","Notice that this particular meaning of the \"variable\" concept is restricted to the domain of statistics.

Below we discuss two examples that are more common.\n","\n","Generally, points in time are indicated by variables measured on an interval scale. Let's say we want to indicate the point in time of the first manned mission on the Moon. If we want to use a ratio scale, our zero point must be meaningful and denote the absence of time. For this reason, we'd basically have to begin the counting at the very beginning of time.\n","\n","There are many problems with this approach. One of them is that we don't know with precision when time began (assuming time actually has a beginning), which means we don't know how far away in time we are from that zero point.\n","\n","To overcome this, we can set an arbitrarily zero point, and measure the distance in time from there. Customary, we use the [Anno domini system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini) where the zero point is arbitrarily set at the moment [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus) was born. Using this system, we can say that the first manned mission on the Moon happened in 1969. This means that the event happened 1968 years after Jesus' birth (1968 because [there's no year 0 in the Anno domini system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_zero)).\n","\n","\n","<left><img width=\"500\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1JS4xmlS_ipz3xS-O41ebZkScbWvxpphj\"></left>\n","\n","\n","If points in time are measured on an interval scale, we need to avoid quantifying the difference in terms of ratio. For instance, it's not true that twice as much time has passed from year 1000 to year 2000.\n","\n","Another common example has to do with measuring temperature. In day to day life, we usually measure temperature on a Celsius or a Fahrenheit scale. These scales are examples of interval scales.\n","\n","0°C or 0°F are arbitrarily set zero points and don't indicate the absence of temperature. If 0°C or 0°F were meaningful zero points, temperatures below 0°C or 0°F wouldn't be possible. But we know that we can go way below 0°C or 0°F.\n","\n","If yesterday was 10°C, and today is 20°C, we can't say that today is twice as hot as yesterday. We can say, however, that today's temperature is 10°C more compared to yesterday.\n","\n","Temperature can be measured on a ratio scale too, and this is done using the Kelvin scale. 0 K (0 degrees Kelvin) is not set arbitrarily, and it indicates the lack of temperature.

Let's consider a small random sample of our data set and focus on the **Weight** and **PTS** (total points) variables, which are both measured on a **ratio scale**.\n","\n","| _   | Name                | Weight | PTS |\n","|-----|---------------------|--------|-----|\n","| 77  | Kayla Thornton      | 86.0   | 32  |\n","| 16  | Asia Taylor         | 76.0   | 31  |\n","| 80  | Kia Vaughn          | 90.0   | 134 |\n","| 137 | Tierra Ruffin-Pratt | 83.0   | 225 |\n","| 12  | Amanda Zahui B.     | 113.0  | 51  |\n","\n","\n","The first two players scored 32 and 31 points, respectively. Between 32 and 31 points there's no possible intermediate value. Provided the measurements are correct, it's impossible to find a player having scored 31.5 or 31.2 points. In basketball, players can only score 1,2 or 3 points at a time, so the points variable can only be expressed in integers when measured on an interval or ratio scale.\n","\n","Generally, **if there's no possible intermediate value between any two adjacent values of a variable**, we call that variable **discrete.**\n","\n","Common examples of discrete variables include **counts of people in a class, a room, an office, a country, a house etc.** For instance, if we counted the number of people living in each house of a given street, the results of our counting can only be integers. For any given house, we could count 1, 3, 7, 0 people, but we cannot count 2.3 people, or 4.1378921521 people.\n","\n","In the table above, we can also see that the first player weighs 86 kg, and the second 76 kg. Between 86 kg and 76 kg, there's an infinity of possible values. In fact, between any two values of the Weight variable, there's an infinity of values.\n","\n","This is strongly counter-intuitive, so let's consider an example of two values that are relatively close together: 86kg and 87kg. Between these values we can have an infinity of values: 86.2 kg, 86.6 kg, 86.40 kg, 86.400001 kg, 86.400000000000001 kg, 86.400000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 kg, and so on.\n","\n","In the diagram below we consider values between 86 and 87 kg, and break down the interval in five equal parts. Then we take two values (86.2 and 86.8) from the interval 86 - 87, and break down the interval between these values (86.2 and 86.8) in five equal parts. Then we repeat the process for the interval 86.2 - 86.8.

The values are automatically converted by **pandas** to **float64** because of one **NaN** value in the **Weight** column, and end up with a trailing zero, which gives the false impression of one decimal point precision. So a player was recorded to weigh 77 kg (zero decimals precision), not 77.0 kg (one decimal precision).\n","\n","Returning to our discussion, if we measure the weight with zero decimals precision (which we do in our data set), a player weighing 77.4 kg will be assigned the same weight (77 kg) as a player weighing 76.6 kg. So if a player is recorded to weigh 77 kg, we can only tell that her actual weight is somewhere between 76.5 kg and 77.5 kg. The value of 77 is not really a distinct value here. Rather, it's an **interval** of values.\n","\n","This principle applies to any possible numerical weight value. If a player is measured to weigh 76.5 kg, we can only tell that her weight is somewhere between 76.45 kg and 76.55 kg. If a player has 76.50 kg, we can only tell that her weight is somewhere between 76.495 kg and 76.505 kg.

The answer is that 88.5 kg is exactly halfway between 88 and 89 kg, and it doesn't necessarily belong to any of those two values. The assignment only depends on how you choose to round numbers: if you round up, then 88.5 kg will be assigned to 89 kg; if you round down, then the value will be assigned to 88 kg.\n","\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<left><img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\"></left>\n","\n","Find the real limits for five values of the BMI (body mass index) variable.\n","- We've already extracted the first five BMI values in the data set and rounded each off to a precision of three decimal places.
