When we execute Python code, the Python interpreter converts your code into bytecode that your computer can understand, and then runs that [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode). When you write code in Python, you don't have to worry about things like allocating memory on your computer or choosing how certain operations are done by your computer's processor. Python takes care of that for you.\n","\n","<img width=\"500\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1WSCD15qS89t5di-x-_WjLHwI6-Tj9EeH\">\n","\n","Python is what we call a **high-level language**. High level languages allow you to write programs faster as the interpreter makes the decisions on how to execute your instructions. In contrast, when you use **low-level** languages like C, you define exactly how memory will be managed and how the processor will execute your instructions. This means that coding in a **low-level language** takes longer, however you have more ability to optimize your code to run faster.\n","\n","| Language Type | Example | Time taken to write program | Control over program performance |\n","|---------------|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n","| High-Level | Python | Low | Low |\n","| Low-Level | C | High | High |\n","\n","When choosing between a high and low-level language, you have to make a trade-off between being able to work and quickly, and having programs that run quickly and efficiently. Luckily, there are two Python libraries that were created to give us the best of both-worlds: **NumPy** and **pandas**. Together, pandas and NumPy provide a powerful toolset for working with data in Python. They allow us to write code quickly without sacrificing performance. But how do they do this? What is it that makes these libraries faster than raw Python? The answer is **vectorization**.\n","\n","\n","**How Vectorization Makes Code Faster**\n","\n","Let's look at an example where we have two columns of data.

Most modern computer processors support SIMD. SIMD allows a processor to perform the same operation, on multiple data points, in a single processor cycle. Let's look at how a vectorized version of our code above might be processed using a SIMD instruction that allows four data points to be processed at once:\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"800\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=149QHZunoElqzhdhP2hb4qEMK3xt8Gg0h\">\n","\n","As a result, the NumPy version of our code would only take two processor cycles — a four times speed-up!
