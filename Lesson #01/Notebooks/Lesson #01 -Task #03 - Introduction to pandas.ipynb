More commonly referred to as **pandas.DataFrame()** objects, or just **dataframes**, the type is the primary pandas data structure. Dataframes are two dimensional pandas objects.\n","\n","We'll learn about the second pandas data structure, series, later in this lesson, but first, let's look at the anatomy of a dataframe, using a selection of our Fortune 500 data:\n","\n","<img width=\"500\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1lUAxPbqauhiMPdWCAM2oPOy0vsmvWtYy\">\n","\n","There are three key things we can observe immediately:\n","\n","- In Red: Just like a 2D ndarray, there are two axes, however each axis of a dataframe has a specific name. The first axis is called **index**, and the second axis is called **columns.**\n","- In Blue: Our axis values have string **labels**, not just numeric locations.\n","- In Green: Our dataframe contains columns with **multiple dtypes**: integer, float, and string.\n","\n","We can use the [DataFrame.dtypes](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.dtypes.html#pandas.DataFrame.dtypes) attribute to return information about the types of each column.

Generally, pandas does a pretty good job with this, which means we don't need to worry about specifying dtypes every time we start to work with data. Later in this course, we'll look at how to change the dtype of a column.\n","\n","Next, let's learn a few handy methods we can use to get some high-level information about our dataframe:\n","\n","- If we wanted to view the first few rows of our dataframe, we can use the [DataFrame.head()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.head.html) method, which returns the first 5 rows of our dataframe. The **DataFrame.head()** method also accepts an optional integer parameter which specified the number of rows. We could use **f500.head(10)** to return the first 10 rows of our **f500 dataframe**.\n","- Similar in function to **DataFrame.head()**, we can use the [DataFrame.tail()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.tail.html) method, to shows us the last rows of our dataframe. The **DataFrame.tail()** method accepts an optional integer parameter to specify the number of rows, defaulting to 5.\n","- If we wanted to get an overview of all the dtypes used in our dataframe, along with its shape and some extra information, we could use the [DataFrame.info()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.info.html#pandas.DataFrame.info) method.

The syntax for the **DataFrame.loc[]** method is:\n","\n","```python\n","df.loc[row, column]\n","```\n","\n","Where **row** and **column** refer to row and column labels respectively, and can be one of:\n","\n","- A single label.\n","- A list or array of labels.\n","- A slice object with labels.\n","- A boolean array.\n","\n","We'll look at boolean arrays later in this mission - for now, we're going to focus on the first three options.

The method tells us how many non-null values are contained in the series, the mean and standard devation, along with the minimum, maximum and [quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) values.\n","\n","Rather than assigning the series to it's own variable, we can actually skip that step and use the method directly on the result of the column selection. This is called **method chaining** and is a way to combine multiple methods together in a single line. It's not unique to pandas, however it is something that you see a lot in pandas code. Let's see what the command looks like with method chaining, using the **assets** column.\n","\n","\n","```python\n","print(f500[\"assets\"].describe())\n","```\n","\n","```python\n","count    5.000000e+02\n","mean     2.436323e+05\n","std      4.851937e+05\n","min      3.717000e+03\n","25%      3.658850e+04\n","50%      7.326150e+04\n","75%      1.805640e+05\n","max      3.473238e+06\n","Name: assets, dtype: float64\n","```\n","\n","From here, you'll start to see method chaining used more in our missions. When writing code, you should always assess whether method chaining will make your code harder to read. It's always preferable to break out into more than one line if it will make your code easier to understand.\n","\n","You might have noticed that the values in the code segment above look a little bit different. Because the values for this column are too long to display neatly, pandas has displayed them in **E-notation**, a type of [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation). Here is an expansion of what the E-notation represents:\n","\n","| Original Notation | Expanded Formula | Result |\n","|-------------------|--------------------|----------|\n","| 5.000000E+02 | 5.000000 * 10 ** 2 | 500 |\n","| 2.436323E+05 | 2.436323 * 10 ** 5 | 243632.3 |\n","\n","\n","If we use **describe()** on a column that contains non-numeric values, we get some different statistics. Let's look at an example:\n","\n","```python\n","print(f500[\"country\"].describe())\n","\n","count     500\n","unique     34\n","top       USA\n","freq      132\n","Name: country, dtype: object\n","```\n","\n","Here is what the output indicates:\n","\n","The first statistic, **count**, is the same as for numeric columns, showing us the number of non-null values. The other three statistics are new:\n","\n","- **unique** - The number of unique values in the series. In this case, it tells us that there are 34 different countries represented in the Fortune 500.\n","- **top** - The most common value in the series. The USA is the most common country that a company in the Fortune 500 is headquartered in.\n","- **freq** - The frequency of the most common value. The USA is the country that 132 companies from Fortune 500 are headquartered in.\n","\n","Because series' and dataframes are two distinct objects, they have their own unique methods. There are many times where both series and dataframe objects have a method of the same name that behaves in similar ways. DataFrame objects also have a [DataFrame.describe()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html) method that returns these same statistics for every column. If you like, you can take a look at the documentation using the link in the previous sentence to familiarize yourself with some of the differences between the two methods.\n","\n","One difference is that you need to specify manually if you want to see the statistics for the non-numeric columns. By default, **DataFrame.describe()** will return statistics for only numeric columns.
